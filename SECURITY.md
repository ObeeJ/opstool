## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security

```yaml
# Kubernetes Security Context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 2000
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

### Configuration Security

```bash
# Environment variables for secure configuration
export OPSTOOL_JWT_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret"
export OPSTOOL_DB_SSL_MODE="require"
export OPSTOOL_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-byte-encryption-key"
export OPSTOOL_LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

### Network Security

- Use TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Implement network segmentation
- Use firewalls and security groups
- Regular security scanning of containers

### Database Security

- Enable SSL/TLS connections
- Use strong passwords and rotate regularly
- Implement database-level encryption
- Regular backup encryption
- Audit database access

### Secret Management

```bash
# Use external secret management
kubectl create secret generic opstool-secrets \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  --from-literal=db-password="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

## Security Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- Database query anomalies
- Container runtime security events
- Network traffic analysis

### Alerting Configuration

```yaml
# Example Prometheus alerting rules
groups:
  - name: opstool-security
    rules:
      - alert: HighFailedLogins
        expr: rate(opstool_failed_logins_total[5m]) > 0.1
        for: 2m
        annotations:
          summary: "High rate of failed login attempts"
      
      - alert: UnauthorizedAPIAccess
        expr: rate(opstool_unauthorized_requests_total[5m]) > 0.05
        for: 1m
        annotations:
          summary: "Unauthorized API access attempts detected"
```
